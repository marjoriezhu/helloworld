This is a project that helping us to understand Git.

the meaning of each file/directory:
- readme.txt
	it is me :)

- project.config
	it is a file to simulate a project config file in noraml dev case, please do change the name(and profile if you want) of this file after you cloning this project

- tasks.txt
	 records current todo list, please add task as you want, and remove tasks that are done

- add-delete(d)
	this is the directory for practicing add&delete files in git

- move(d)
	this is the directory for practicing move/rename files in git

- update(d)
	this is the directory for practicing updating files in git


everying thing in these three dirs(add-delete, move, update) are editable, but don't remove/rename/move these thress dirs.


workflow:
1. pull updates from server
2. open tasks.txt and pick the task you want to do
3. do the task
4. remove the tasks you have done in tasks.txt file
5. add tasks into tasks.txt to make sure there are enough tasks for others
6. commit and push you changes


commit rules:
- add comment with the task content in each commit, if one commit contains more than one task, add all the tasks content
- push your commit only at the end of the day(maybe around 5:00pm), so we can have more conflicts
